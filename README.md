This repository contains the source for the official [Amazon Web Services SDK for Ruby Developer
Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/developer-guide).
It provides information about how to install, set up, and use the
[Amazon Web Services SDK for Ruby](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby) to create Ruby
applications that use Amazon Web Services.

The guide content is written in Markdown. It relies on content that is provided in the Amazon Web
Services documentation team's [shared content](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-shared-content)
and [SDK examples](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples) repositories.

Reporting issues
================

You can use the [Issues](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-ruby-developer-guide/issues) section of this
repository to report problems in the documentation. *When submitting an issue, please indicate*:

* The page (a URL or file name is best) that the issue occurs on.

* What the issue is, using as much detail as you can provide. For many issues, this might be as
  simple as "The page has a typo; the word 'complie' in the third paragraph shoud be 'compile'." If
  the issue is more complex, please describe it with enough detail that it's clear to the Amazon Web
  Services documentation team what the problem is.

Contributing fixes and updates
==============================

To contribute your own documentation fixes or updates, please use the Github-standard procedures for
[forking the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and submitting a
[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

Note that many common substitutions found in these docs are sourced from the
[shared content](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-shared-content) repository. If you see a
substitution used that isn't declared at the top of the source file, then it's probably defined in
the shared content.

Code examples in the documentation
==================================

You can find the code examples featured in this documentation in a separate repository:
[aws-doc-sdk-examples](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/ruby). Full
code and build files are included, so you can build and run any of the provided examples yourself.

In addition to examples in Ruby, you'll also find examples for each of the other Amazon Web
Services SDKs. If you find issues with any of the examples, you can submit issues or fork the
repository and submit a pull request!

The code examples are provided under the *Apache 2.0* open source license. See the example
repository's [README](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/README.md) for
more details.
