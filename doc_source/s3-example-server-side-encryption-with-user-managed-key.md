# Adds an encrypted object to an Amazon S3 bucket. The encryption is performed
#   on the server by using the specified encryption key.
#
# Prerequisites:
#
# - An Amazon S3 bucket.
# - An AES256-GCM key.
#
# @param s3_client [Aws::S3::Client] An initialized Amazon S3 client.
# @param bucket_name [String] The name of the bucket.
# @param object_key [String] The name to assign to the uploaded object.
# @param content_to_encrypt [String] The content to be encrypted.
# @param encryption_key [String] The decoded representation of the
#   base64-encoded encryption key string to be used for encryption.
# @return [Boolean] true if the encrypted object was successfully uploaded;
#   otherwise, false.
# @example
#   exit 1 unless customer_key_sse_encrypted_object_uploaded?(
#     Aws::S3::Client.new(region: 'us-east-1'),
#     'doc-example-bucket',
