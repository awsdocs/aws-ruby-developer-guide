        Encrypt data in AWS KMS using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, KMS

The following example uses the |sdk-ruby| 
`encrypt method <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/KMS/Client.html#encrypt-instance_method>`_,
which implements the
`Encrypt operation <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Encrypt.html>`_,
to encrypt the string "1234567890".
The example displays a readable version of the resulting encrypted blob.
