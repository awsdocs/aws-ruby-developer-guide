    :description:
        Add new IAM users with this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, IAM

The following example creates the |IAM| user :code:`my_groovy_user` in the :code:`us-west-2` region with the password :code:`REPLACE_ME`,
and displays the user's account ID. If a user with that name already exists, it displays a message and does not create a new user.
