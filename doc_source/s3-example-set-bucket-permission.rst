Managing |S3| Bucket and Object Access Permissions

    :description:
        Manage access permissions for Amazon S3 buckets and objects using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples

This example demonstrates how to use the |sdk-ruby| to:

#. Set a predefined grant (also known as a :dfn:`canned ACL`) for a bucket in |S3|.
#. Add an object to the bucket.
#. Set a canned ACL for an object in the bucket.
#. Get the bucket's current ACL.

For the complete code for this example, see :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-s3-example-set-bucket-permission-code`.

.. _aws-ruby-sdk-s3-example-set-bucket-permission-prereqs:

Prerequisites
=============

To set up and run this example, you must first:

#. Install the |sdk-ruby|. For more information, see :doc:`setup-install`.
#. Set the AWS access credentials that the |sdk-ruby| will use to verify your access to AWS services and resources. For more information, see :doc:`setup-config`.

Be sure the AWS credentials map to an |IAMlong| (|IAM|) entity with access to the AWS actions and resources described in this example.

This example assumes you have set the credentials in the AWS credentials profile file or in the :code:`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
:code:`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables on your local system.

.. _aws-ruby-sdk-s3-example-set-bucket-permission-config:

Configure the SDK
=================

For this example, add a :code:`require` statement so that you can use the classes and methods
provided by the |sdk-ruby| for |S3|. Then create an :ruby-sdk-api:`Aws::S3::Client <Aws/S3/Client.html>` object in the AWS Region where you want to
create the bucket. This code creates the :code:`Aws::S3::Client` object in the :code:`us-west-2` region. This code also declares a variable representing the bucket.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3-ruby-example-access-permissions.rb
   :lines: 13-16
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

.. _aws-ruby-sdk-s3-example-set-bucket-permission-bucket-acl:

Set a Canned ACL for a Bucket
=============================

Call the :ruby-sdk-api:`put_bucket_acl <Aws/S3/Client.html#put_bucket_acl-instance_method>` method, specifying the names of the canned ACL and the bucket. This code
sets the :code:`public-read` canned ACL on the bucket, which enables full control for the bucket's owner and read-only access for everyone else.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3-ruby-example-access-permissions.rb
   :lines: 20-23
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

For more information about canned ACLs, see **Canned ACL** in :S3-dg:`Access Control List (ACL)
Overview <acl-overview>` in the |S3-dg|.

To confirm this setting, call the Ruby :code:`Net::HTTP.get` method to attempt to get the bucket's content.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3-ruby-example-access-permissions.rb
   :lines: 34-36
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

.. _aws-ruby-sdk-s3-example-set-bucket-permission-upload-object:

Upload an Object to a Bucket
============================

Call the :ruby-sdk-api:`put_object <Aws/S3/Client.html#put_object-instance_method>` method, specifying
the names of the bucket and object and the object's content.
This code declares a variable representing the object.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3-ruby-example-access-permissions.rb
   :lines: 25-31
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

.. _aws-ruby-sdk-s3-example-set-bucket-permission-object-acl:

Set a Canned ACL for an Object
==============================

By default, you can't get the contents of the object in the bucket. To
confirm this behavior, call the Ruby :code:`Net::HTTP.get` method to attempt to get the object's content.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3-ruby-example-access-permissions.rb
   :lines: 39-41
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

To change this behavior, call the :ruby-sdk-api:`put_object_acl <Aws/S3/Client.html#put_object_acl-instance_method>` method, specifying the names of the canned ACL, bucket, and object. This code
sets the :code:`public-read` canned ACL on the object, which enables full control for the object's owner
and read-only access for everyone else. After the call, try to get the object's content again.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3-ruby-example-access-permissions.rb
   :lines: 44-50
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

.. _aws-ruby-sdk-s3-example-set-bucket-permission-get-bucket-acl:

Get a Bucket's Current ACL
==========================

Call the :ruby-sdk-api:`get_bucket_acl <Aws/S3/Client.html#get_bucket_acl-instance_method>` method, specifying the name of the bucket. The :code:`get_bucket_acl` method returns an
instance of the :ruby-sdk-api:`Aws::S3::Types::GetBucketAclOutput <Aws/S3/Types/GetBucketAclOutput.html>` class. Use the :code:`grants` attribute of the
:code:`GetBucketAclOutput` class to list the bucket's current ACL.
