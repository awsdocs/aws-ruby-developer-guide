        Get information about IAM users with this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, IAM

The following example lists the groups, policies, and access key IDs of the
|IAM| users in the :code:`us-west-2` region.
If there are more than 100 users, :code:`iam.list_users.IsTruncated` is **true**
and :code:`iam.list_users.Marker` contains a value you can use to get information
about additional users.
See the `Aws::IAM::Client.list_users <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/IAM/Client.html#list_users-instance_method>`_
topic for further information.
