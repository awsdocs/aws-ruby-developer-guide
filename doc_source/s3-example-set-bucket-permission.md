# Managing Amazon S3 Bucket and Object Access Permissions<a name="s3-example-set-bucket-permission"></a>

The following code example shows how to:

1. Set the initial access level of an Amazon S3 bucket to private\.

1. Attempt to access and upload an object to the bucket, which should fail\.

1. Set the access level to public\-read\.

1. Attempt to access and upload an object to the bucket, which should now succeed\.

1. Set the access level back to private\.

1. Attempt to access and upload an object to the bucket, which should now fail\.
