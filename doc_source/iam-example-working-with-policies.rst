        Learn to work with IAM policies using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, IAM

An |IAM| policy is a document that specifies one or more permissions. For more information about IAM policies, see :IAM-ug:`Overview of IAM Policies <access_policies>`.

In this example, you use the |sdk-ruby| with |IAM| to:

#. Create a policy, using :aws-ruby-iam-client-method:`create_policy`.
#. Get information about the policy, using :aws-ruby-iam-client-method:`get_policy`.
#. Attach the policy to a role, using :aws-ruby-iam-client-method:`attach_role_policy`.
#. List policies attached to the role, using :aws-ruby-iam-client-method:`list_attached_role_policies`.
#. Detach the policy from the role, using :aws-ruby-iam-client-method:`detach_role_policy`.

*************
Prerequisites
*************

Before running the example code, you need to install and configure the |sdk-ruby|, as described
in:

* :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-setup-install`
* :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-setup-config`

You will also need to create the role (`my-role`) specified in the script. You can do this in the |IAM| console.
