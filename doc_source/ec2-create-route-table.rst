        Create an Amazon EC2 route table using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, Amazon EC2

The following example creates a route table named :code:`MyGroovyRouteTable` in :code:`us-west-2` region
on a VPC with the ID :code:`VPC_ID`.
The route table uses the route with the CIDR block :code:`0.0.0.0/0`, and the gateway with the ID :code:`IGW_ID`.
The example associates the route table with the subnet that has ID :code:`SUBNET_ID`, and then displays the route table's ID.
