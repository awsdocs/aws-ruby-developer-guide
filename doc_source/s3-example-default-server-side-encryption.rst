##############################################################
Setting Default Server-Side Encryption for an Amazon S3 Bucket
##############################################################

.. meta::
    :description:
        Encrypt Amazon S3 bucket items by default using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples

The following example uses the
:ruby-sdk-api:`put_bucket_encryption <Aws/S3/Client.html#put_bucket_encryption-instance_method>`
method to enable KMS server-side encryption on any items added to
:code-ruby:`my_bucket` in the :code:`us-west-2` region.

The only exception is if the user configures their request to explicitly
use server-side encryption. In that case, the specified encryption takes precedence.

Choose :code:`Copy` to save the code locally.

Create the file *add_default_sse_encryption.rb*.

Add the required |S3| gem.

.. note:: Version 2 of the |sdk-ruby| didn't have service-specific gems.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_add_default_sse_encryption.rb
   :lines: 13
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Get the KMS key from the command line,
Where :code:`key` is a KMS key ID as created in the :doc:`kms-example-create-key` example.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_add_default_sse_encryption.rb
   :lines: 16-21
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Create an |S3| client and call :code:`put_bucket_encryption` to add
default encryption to the bucket.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_add_default_sse_encryption.rb
   :lines: 27-37
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby
