   :description:
        Receive messages using the Amazon SQS QueuePoller class with this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, SQS

The following example uses the :code:`QueuePoller` utility class to display the body of all messages
in the |SQS| queue with the URL :code:`URL` in the :code:`us-west-2` region, and deletes the message.
After approximately 15 seconds of inactivity, the script times out.

.. literalinclude:: ./sqs/sqs-ruby-example-poll-messages.rb
   :lines: 13-21
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

The following example loops through the |SQS| queue with the URL :code:`URL`, and waits up to *duration* seconds.

You can get the correct URL by executing the |SQS| example in :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-sqs-example-show-queues`.

.. literalinclude:: ./sqs/sqs-ruby-example-long-polling.rb
   :lines: 13-21
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

The following example loops through the |SQS| queue with the URL :code:`URL`, and gives you up to
the visibility *timeout* seconds to process the message, represented by the method
:code:`do_something`.

.. literalinclude:: ./sqs/sqs-ruby-example-visibility-timeout.rb
   :lines: 13-26
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

The following example loops through the |SQS| queue with the URL :code:`URL`, and changes the
visibility *timeout* seconds, for any message that needs additional processing by the method
:code:`do_something2`.

.. literalinclude:: ./sqs/sqs-ruby-example-visibility-timeout2.rb
   :lines: 13-36
