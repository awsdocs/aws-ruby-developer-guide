    :description:
        Upload an item with metadata to an Amazon S3 bucket using this AWS SDK for Ruby code
        example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples

The following example uploads the item (file) :file:`C:\file.txt` with the metadata key-value pair
:code-ruby:`answer` and :code-ruby:`42` to the bucket :code-ruby:`my-bucket` in the
:code:`us-west-2` region.  Because :file:`C:\file.txt` is the fully qualified name of the file, the
name of the item is set to the file name.
