.. meta::
   :description: Receive messages using long polling in Amazon SQS using the AWS SDK for Ruby.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, SQS

The following example waits up to 10 seconds to display the bodies of up to 10 messages in the |SQS|
queue with the URL :code:`URL` in the :code:`us-west-2` region.

If you do not specify a wait time, the default value is **0** (|SQS| does not wait).
