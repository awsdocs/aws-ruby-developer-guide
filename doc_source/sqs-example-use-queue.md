# Working with Queues in Amazon SQS<a name="sqs-example-use-queue"></a>

Amazon SQS provides highly scalable hosted queues for storing messages as they travel between applications or microservices\. To learn more about queues, see [How Amazon SQS Queues Work](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-how-it-works.html)\.

In this example, you use the AWS SDK for Ruby with Amazon SQS to:

1. Get a list of your queues by using [Aws::SQS::Client\#list\_queues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/Aws/SQS/Client.html#list_queues-instance_method)\.

1. Create a queue by using [Aws::SQS::Client\#create\_queue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/Aws/SQS/Client.html#create_queue-instance_method)\.

1. Get the queueâ€™s URL by using [Aws::SQS::Client\#get\_queue\_url](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/Aws/SQS/Client.html#get_queue_url-instance_method)\.

1. Delete the queue by using [Aws::SQS::Client\#delete\_queue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/Aws/SQS/Client.html#delete_queue-instance_method)\.

## Prerequisites<a name="prerequisites"></a>

Before running the example code, you need to install and configure the AWS SDK for Ruby, as described in:
+  [Installing the AWS SDK for Ruby](setup-install.md#aws-ruby-sdk-setup-install) 
+  [Configuring the AWS SDK for Ruby](setup-config.md#aws-ruby-sdk-setup-config)

puts queue_url

# Delete the queue.
