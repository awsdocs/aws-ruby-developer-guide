Getting Information about Custom Metrics for |CWlong|

   :description: Get custom metrics information for Amazon CloudWatch using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, CloudWatch

A |CW| alarm watches a single metric over a time period you specify. The |CW| alarm performs
one or more actions based on the value of the metric, relative to a given threshold over a number of time periods. For more information, see :CW-ug:`Creating Amazon CloudWatch Alarms <AlarmThatSendsEmail>`.

In this example, you use the |sdk-ruby| with |CW| to:

#. Send custom metrics to |CW| by using `Aws::CloudWatch::Client#put_metric_data <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/CloudWatch/Client.html#put_metric_data-instance_method>`_.
#. Get information about custom metrics by using `Aws::CloudWatch::Client#list_metrics-instance <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/CloudWatch/Client.html#list_metrics-instance_method>`_.

*************
Prerequisites
*************

Before running the example code, you need to install and configure the |sdk-ruby|, as described
in:

* :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-setup-install`
* :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-setup-config`
