# Using the SDK with Ruby on Rails<a name="rails"></a>

 [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) provides a web development framework that makes it easy to create websites with Ruby\.

AWS provides the `aws-sdk-rails` gem to enable easy integration with Rails\. You can use AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS OpsWorks, AWS CodeDeploy, or the [AWS Rails Provisioner](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-rails-provisioner) to deploy and run your Rails applications in the AWS Cloud\.

For information on installing and using the `aws-sdk-rails` gem, see the GitHub repository [https://github\.com/aws/aws\-sdk\-rails](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-rails)\.
