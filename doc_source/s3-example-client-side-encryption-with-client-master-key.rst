    :description:
        Encrypt Amazon S3 bucket items with a client-side master key using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples

The following example uses the
:ruby-sdk-api:`put_object <Aws/S3/Client.html#put_object-instance_method>` method
to add the item :code-ruby:`my_item` to the bucket
:code-ruby:`my_bucket` in the :code:`us-west-2` region.

Choose :code:`Copy` to save the code locally.

Create the file *encrypt_item_cseaes.rb*.

Add the required |S3| gem.

.. note:: Version 2 of the |sdk-ruby| didn't have service-specific gems.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_add_csaes_encrypt_item.rb
   :lines: 13
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Get the key from the command-line.
If there is no command-line argument,
print an error message and quit.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_add_csaes_encrypt_item.rb
   :lines: 15-22
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Set the bucket name and object filename.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_add_csaes_encrypt_item.rb
   :lines: 24-25
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Open the file and get its contents as a string.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_add_csaes_encrypt_item.rb
   :lines: 28
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Create an |S3| encryption client, call :code:`put_object` to upload the item to the bucket,
and display a success message.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_add_csaes_encrypt_item.rb
   :lines: 31-40
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

See the `complete example
<https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/ruby/s3/s3_add_csaes_encrypt_item.rb>`_
on GitHub.

The following example creates a 256-bit AES key and displays the value as a string.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_create_AES_key.rb
   :lines: 13-22
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

See the `complete example
<https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/ruby/s3/s3_create_AES_key.rb>`_,
which includes the code you need to decode the encoded value,
on GitHub.
