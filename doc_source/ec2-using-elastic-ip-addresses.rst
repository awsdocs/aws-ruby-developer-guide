Using Elastic IP Addresses in |EC2|
###################################

   :description: Learn to use Elastic IP addresses in Amazon EC2 using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, Amazon EC2

An Elastic IP address is a static IP address, designed for dynamic cloud computing, that is
associated with your AWS account. It's a public IP address, which is reachable from the internet.
If your instance doesn't have a public IP address, you can use an Elastic IP address with your instance
so that it can communicate with the internet.

For more information about Elastic IP addresses in |EC2|, see :EC2-ug:`Elastic IP Addresses <elastic-ip-addresses-eip>`
in the |EC2-ug| or :EC2-ug-win:`Elastic IP Addresses <elastic-ip-addresses-eip>`
in the |EC2-ug-win|.

In this example, you use the |sdk-ruby| with |EC2| to:

#. Allocate an Elastic IP address by using the
   `Aws::EC2::Client#allocate_address <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/EC2/Client.html#allocate_address-instance_method>`_
   method.
#. Associate the address with an |EC2| instance by using the
   `Aws::EC2::Client#associate_address <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/EC2/Client.html#associate_address-instance_method>`_ method.
#. Get information about addresses associated with the instance by using the
   `Aws::EC2::Client#describe_addresses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/EC2/Client.html#describe_addresses-instance_method>`_ method.
#. Release the address by using the
   `Aws::EC2::Client#release_address <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/EC2/Client.html#release_address-instance_method>`_ method.

The `complete code <https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/ruby/ec2/ec2-ruby-example-elastic-ips.rb>`_
for this example is available on GitHub.

*************
Prerequisites
*************

Before working with the example code, you need to install and configure the |sdk-ruby|, as described
in:

* :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-setup-install`
* :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-setup-config`

You also need to :EC2-ug:`launch an EC2 instance <ec2-launch-instance_linux>`
and note the instance ID.

.. note:: Before you run the following code, you must replace the ``INSTANCE-ID`` string with
          your actual instance ID. This will be something like ``i-0a123456b7c8defg9``.
