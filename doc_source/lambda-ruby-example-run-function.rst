########################
Running a |LAM| Function
########################

.. meta::
    :description:
        Run an AWS Lambda function using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, Lambda

The following example runs the |LAM| function named :code:`MyGetitemsFunction` in the :code:`us-west-2`
region.
This function returns a list of items from a database. The input JSON looks like the following.

.. code-block:: json

   {
      "SortBy": "name|time",
      "SortOrder": "ascending|descending",
      "Number": 50
   }

where:

* :code:`SortBy` is the criteria for sorting the results. Our examples uses :code:`time`,
  which means the returned items are sorted in the order in which they were added to the database.

* :code:`SortOrder` is the order of sorting. Our example uses :code:`descending`,
  which means the most-recent item is last in the list.

* :code:`Number` is the maximum number of items to retrieve (the default is 50).
  Our example uses :code:`10`, which means get the 10 most-recent items.

The output JSON looks like the following,
where:

* :code:`STATUS-CODE` is an HTTP status code, :code:`200` means the call was successful.
* :code:`RESULT` is the result of the call, either :code:`success` or :code:`failure`.
* :code:`ERROR` is an error message if :code:`result` is :code:`failure`, otherwise an empty string
* :code:`DATA` is an array of returned results if :code:`result` is :code:`success`, otherwise nil.

.. code-block:: json

   {
      "statusCode": "STATUS-CODE",
      "body": {
         "result": "RESULT",
         "error": "ERROR",
         "data": "DATA"
      }
   }

The first step is to load the modules we use:

* :code:`aws-sdk` loads the AWS SDK for Ruby module we use to invoke the |lam| function.

* :code:`json` loads the JSON module we use to marshall and unmarshall the request and response payloads.

* :code:`os` loads the OS module we use to ensure we can run our Ruby application on Microsoft Windows.
  If you are on a different operating system, you can remove those lines.

.. literalinclude:: ./lambda/aws-ruby-sdk-lambda-example-run-function.rb
   :lines: 13-20
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

We then create the |lam| client we use to invoke the |lam| function.

.. literalinclude:: ./lambda/aws-ruby-sdk-lambda-example-run-function.rb
   :lines: 22
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Next we create the hash for the request arguments and call :code:`MyGetItemsFunction`.

.. literalinclude:: ./lambda/aws-ruby-sdk-lambda-example-run-function.rb
   :lines: 25-33
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Finally we parse the response, and if are successful, we print out the items.

.. literalinclude:: ./lambda/aws-ruby-sdk-lambda-example-run-function.rb
   :lines: 35-46
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby
