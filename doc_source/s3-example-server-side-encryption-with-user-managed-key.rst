Encrypting an Amazon S3 Bucket Object with an AWS KMS Key

    :description:
        Encrypt Amazon S3 bucket objects with an AWS KMS key using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples

The following example uses the
:ruby-sdk-api:`put_object <Aws/S3/Client.html#put_object-instance_method>` method
to add the object :code-ruby:`my_item` to the bucket
:code-ruby:`my_bucket` in the :code:`us-west-2` region
with server-side AWS KMS encryption where you provide the key.
See :doc:`kms-example-create-key` for information on creating an AWS KMS key.

Amazon S3 uses, but does not store, the AWS KMS key that you provide.

Choose :code:`Copy` to save the code locally.

Create the file *encrypt_object_sseck.rb*.

Add the required |S3| and **md5** gems.

.. note:: Version 2 of the |sdk-ruby| didn't have service-specific gems.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_add_sseck_encrypt_item.rb
   :lines: 13-14
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Get the key from the command-line.
If there is no command-line argument,
print an error message and quit.
Otherwise, create an MD5 hash of the key.
Amazon S3 uses the hash to ensure the integrity of the key.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_add_sseck_encrypt_item.rb
   :lines: 17-23
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Set the bucket and object names, and get the contents of the object from the file as a string.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_add_sseck_encrypt_item.rb
   :lines: 25-26, 29
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Create an |S3| client and call :code:`put_object` to upload the object to the bucket.
Notice that the :code:`server_side_encryption` property is set to :code:`aws:kms`,
indicating that |S3| encrypts the object using the provided AWS KMS key.
Finally, display a success message to the user.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_add_sseck_encrypt_item.rb
   :lines: 32-44
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby
