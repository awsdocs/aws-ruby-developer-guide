        Get Amazon S3 bucket item information using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, Amazon S3

A presigned URL gives you access to the object identified in the URL, if the creator of the
presigned URL has permissions to access that object. You can use a presigned URL to allow a user to
click a link and see an item without having to make the item public.

The following example lists the names and presigned URLs of the first 50 items of the bucket
:code-ruby:`my-bucket` in the :code:`us-west-2` region.  If a limit is not specified, |S3| lists up
to 1,000 items.
