        Learn to manage IAM users with this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.

An |IAM| user represents a person or service that interacts with AWS. For more information about |IAM| users, see :IAM-ug:`IAM Users <id_users>`.

In this example, you use the |sdk-ruby| with |IAM| to:

#. Get information about available AWS |IAM| users by using :aws-ruby-iam-client-method:`list_users`.
#. Create a user by using :aws-ruby-iam-client-method:`create_user`.
#. Update the user's name by using :aws-ruby-iam-client-method:`update_user`.
#. Delete the user by using :aws-ruby-iam-client-method:`delete_user`.

*************
Prerequisites

Before running the example code, you need to install and configure the |sdk-ruby|, as described
in:
