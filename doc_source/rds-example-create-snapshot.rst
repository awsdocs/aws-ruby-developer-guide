        Create snapshots of Amazon RDS instances using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples

The following example creates a snapshot for the |RDS| instance represented by *instance_name* in the :code:`us-west-2` region.

.. note:: If your instance is a member of a cluster, you can't create a snapshot of the instance.
     Instead, you must create a snapshot of the cluster (see :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-rds-example-create-cluster-snapshot`).
