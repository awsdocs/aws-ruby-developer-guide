   :description: Send events to Amazon CloudWatch Events using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, CloudWatch Events

|CWE| delivers a near real-time stream of system events that describe changes in AWS resources to |LAMlong|
functions or other targets. See :CWE-dg:`What is Amazon CloudWatch Events? <WhatIsCloudWatchEvents>` to
learn more.
In this example, you use the |sdk-ruby| with |CWE| to:

#. Create a rule in |CWE| by using :aws-ruby-cwe-client-method:`put_rule`.
#. Add a target to the rule by using :aws-ruby-cwe-client-method:`put_targets`.
#. Send an event to |CWE| so that it can be matched to the rule.
#. View the results in |CWLlong| and metrics by using
   :aws-ruby-cw-client-method:`get_metric_statistics` and :aws-ruby-cwl-client-method:`describe_log_streams`.

*************
Prerequisites
*************

Before running the example code, you need to install and configure the |sdk-ruby|, as described
in:

* :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-setup-install`
* :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-setup-config`

You also need to:

* Replace the placeholder value assigned to `lambda_function_arn` with an actual |LAM| function ARN.

  #. Create a |LAM| function, as described `here <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/LogEC2InstanceState.html#ec2-create-lambda-function>`_.
  #. Name the function `LogEC2InstanceStateChange`.
  #. For a role, select **Choose an Existing Role**. For the existing role, select **lambda_basic_execution**.
  #. After you create the function, copy the ARN and paste it into your code.

* Replace the placeholder value assigned to `cwe_service_role_arn` with an appropriate |IAMlong| service
  role ARN.

  #. In the |IAM| console, create a role and attach a policy that grants full access to |CWE|.
  #. Ensure that the role has a trust relationship to `events.amazonaws.com`. For an example policy and role, see the comments in the `example code on GitHub <https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/ruby/cloudwatch/cw-ruby-example-send-events-ec2.rb>`_.
  #. After you create the role, attach the policy, and establish the trust relationship, copy the role ARN and paste it into your code.

* Replace the placeholder value assigned to `instance_id` with an actual |EC2| instance ID.
