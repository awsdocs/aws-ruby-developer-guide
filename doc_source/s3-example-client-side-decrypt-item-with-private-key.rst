Decrypting an Amazon S3 Bucket Object with a Private Key

    :description:
        Decrypt Amazon S3 bucket objects with client-side private keys using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples

The following example uses the
:ruby-sdk-api:`get_object <Aws/S3/Client.html#get_object-instance_method>` method
to get the object :code-ruby:`my_item` from the bucket
:code-ruby:`my_bucket` in the :code:`us-west-2` region. Then it
decrypts the contents with the
`PKey <http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/openssl/rdoc/OpenSSL/PKey.html>`_
class.

Choose :code:`Copy` to save the code locally.

Create the file *decrypt_object_csepk.rb*.

Add the required |S3| and OpenSSL gems.

.. note:: Version 2 of the |sdk-ruby| didn't have service-specific gems.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3-ruby-example-get-cspk-item.rb
   :lines: 13-14
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Get the pass phrase from the command line.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3-ruby-example-get-cspk-item.rb
   :lines: 16-21
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Set the bucket name, object name, and name of the private key file.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3-ruby-example-get-cspk-item.rb
   :lines: 23-25
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Create an RSA key from the contents of the key file and passphrase.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3-ruby-example-get-cspk-item.rb
   :lines: 28-29
   :dedent: 2
   :language: ruby

Create an |S3| encryption client, call :code:`get_object`, get the contents of the object as text
and print out the object's contents.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3-ruby-example-get-cspk-item.rb
   :lines: 32,34,36
   :dedent: 2
