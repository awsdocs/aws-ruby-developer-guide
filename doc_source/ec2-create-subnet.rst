        Create public subnets for Amazon EC2 using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, Amazon EC2

The following example creates a public subnet :code:`MyGroovySubnet` in the :code:`us-west-2` region
and the Availablity Zone :code:`us-west-2a`. The example attaches the public subnet to a VPC with the ID :code:`VPC_ID` that uses the CIDR block :code:`10.200.10.0/24`, and then
displays the subnet's ID.

The public subnet created in this example has 256 private IP addresses within the VPC.
