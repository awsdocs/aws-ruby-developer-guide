        Send and receive messages to Amazon SQS queues using this AWS SDK for Ruby
        code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, SQS

After you create a queue in |SQS|, you can send a message to it and then consume it. To learn more, see :SQS-dg:`Tutorial: Sending a Message to an Amazon SQS Queue <sqs-send-message>` and :SQS-dg:`Tutorial: Receiving and Deleting a Message from an Amazon SQS Queue <sqs-receive-delete-message>`.

In this example, you use the |sdk-ruby| with |SQS| to:

1. Send a message to a queue by using :aws-ruby-sqs-client-method:`send_message`.
   
.. note:: If your queue is a FIFO queue, you must include a
   :code:`message_group_id` parameter in addition to the
   :code:`id` and :code:`message_body` parameters.
                
2. Receive the message in the queue by using :aws-ruby-sqs-client-method:`receive_message`.
3. Display information about the message.
4. Delete the message from the queue by using :aws-ruby-sqs-client-method:`delete_message`.

*************
Prerequisites
*************

Before running the example code, you need to install and configure the |sdk-ruby|, as described
in:

* :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-setup-install`
* :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-setup-config`

You also need to create the queue `my-queue`, which you can do in the |SQS| console.
