        Trigger a notification when items in an Amazon S3 bucket change using this AWS
        SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, Amazon S3

You can trigger a notification when there is a change in the objects in a bucket. These changes
include:

* When an object is added to the bucket

* When an object is removed from the bucket

* When an object stored with Reduced Redundancy is lost

You can configure the service to send a notification to:

* An |SNS| topic

* An |SQS| queue

* A |LAMlong| function

To create a bucket notification, use the following procedure.

1. :ref:`Grant Amazon S3 permission to publish an item to a queue or topic, or invoke a Lambda function
   <aws-ruby-sdk-s3-example-grant-s3-permission>`.

2. :ref:`Set the bucket's Notification Configuration to point to the queue, topic, or function
   <aws-ruby-sdk-s3-example-set-notification>`.

After you do these steps, your application can respond to the information. For example,
the |LAM| topic
:LAM-dg:`Programming Model <programming-model-v2>` describes how to use the various
programming languages that |LAM| supports.

Enabling |S3| to Send a Notification
------------------------------------

Learn how to configure an |SNS| topic or |SQS| queue, or create a |LAM| function so that
|S3| can send a notification to them.

* :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-sns-example-enable-resource`

* :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-sqs-example-enable-resource`

* :ref:`lambda-ruby-example-configure-function-for-notification`

.. _aws-ruby-sdk-s3-example-set-notification:

Creating an |S3| Bucket Notification
------------------------------------

This example enables the |S3| bucket :code-ruby:`my-bucket` to send a notification to the
following when an item is added to the bucket:

* The |SNS| topic with the ARN :code-ruby:`my-topic-arn`

* The |SQS| queue with the ARN :code-ruby:`my-queue-arn`

* The |LAM| function with the ARN :code-ruby:`my-function-arn`
