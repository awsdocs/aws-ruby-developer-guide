#####################################
Using a |S3| Bucket to Host a Website
#####################################

.. meta::
    :description:
        Use an Amazon S3 bucket to host a website using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, Amazon S3

This example demonstrates how to use the |sdk-ruby| to:

#. Create an |S3| bucket.
#. Get the bucket website's configuration.
#. Add objects to the bucket.
#. Set the bucket website's configuration.
#. Access the bucket website's documents.
#. Delete the bucket website.
#. Delete the bucket.

For information about bucket website hosting, see :S3-dg:`Configure a Bucket for Website Hosting <HowDoIWebsiteConfiguration>` in the |S3-dg|.

For the complete code for this example, see :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-s3-example-bucket-website-code`.

.. _aws-ruby-sdk-s3-example-bucket-website-prereqs:

Prerequisites
=============

To set up and run this example, you must first:

#. Install the |sdk-ruby|. For more information, see :doc:`setup-install`.
#. Set the AWS access credentials that the |sdk-ruby| will use to verify your access to AWS services and resources. For more information, see :doc:`setup-config`.

Be sure the AWS credentials map to an |IAMlong| (|IAM|) entity with access to the AWS actions and resources described in this example.

This example assumes you have set the credentials in the AWS credentials profile file or in the
:envvar:`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and :envvar:`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables on your local system.

.. _aws-ruby-sdk-s3-example-bucket-website-config:

Configure the SDK
=================

For this example, add a :code:`require` statement so that you can use the classes and methods
provided by the |sdk-ruby| for |S3|. Then create an :ruby-sdk-api:`Aws::S3::Client <Aws/S3/Client.html>` object in the AWS Region where you want to
create the bucket and the specified AWS profile. This code creates the :code:`Aws::S3::Client` object
in the :code:`us-east-2` region.

An additional variable is also declared for the bucket used in this example. To help ensure the bucket name is unique across all AWS accounts, an
additional :code:`require` statement is added, and the :code:`SecureRandom` module's
:code:`uuid` method is called to generate a unique identifier. This identifier is inserted into the
name of the bucket to be created later in this example.

.. _aws-ruby-sdk-s3-example-bucket-website-create-bucket:

Create a Bucket
===============

Call the :ruby-sdk-api:`create_bucket <Aws/S3/Client.html#create_bucket-instance_method>` method, supplying the name of the bucket to create.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_ruby_bucket_website.rb
   :lines: 21

   :language: ruby

.. _aws-ruby-sdk-s3-example-bucket-website-get-config:

Get a Bucket Website's Configuration
====================================

Call the :ruby-sdk-api:`get_bucket_website <Aws/S3/Client.html#get_bucket_website-instance_method>` method, supplying the name of the bucket.
By default, a bucket is not configured as a website. To confirm this behavior, call the
:code:`get_bucket_website` method. This returns an error, because there is no website configuration for the bucket.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_ruby_bucket_website.rb
   :lines: 24-28
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

.. _aws-ruby-sdk-s3-example-bucket-website-add-object:

Add an Object to a Bucket
=========================

Call the :ruby-sdk-api:`put_object <Aws/S3/Client.html#put_object-instance_method>` method, supplying the name of the bucket and object,
the object's contents, and the object's access permissions set. This example adds two
webpages to the bucket.

   :language: ruby

.. _aws-ruby-sdk-s3-example-bucket-website-set-config:

Set a Bucket Website's Configuration
====================================

Call the :ruby-sdk-api:`put_bucket_website <Aws/S3/Client.html#put_bucket_website-instance_method>` method, supplying the name of the bucket and
the website configuration. For the website configuration, use an :ruby-sdk-api:`Aws::S3::Types::WebsiteConfiguration <Aws/S3/Types/WebsiteConfiguration.html>` hash, supplying the website's
index and error webpages.

.. _aws-ruby-sdk-s3-example-bucket-website-get-docs:

Access a Bucket Website's Documents
===================================

Call the Ruby :code:`Net::HTTP.get` method, supplying the address to the document in the bucket website.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_ruby_bucket_website.rb
   :lines: 56-60
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

.. _aws-ruby-sdk-s3-example-bucket-website-delete:

Delete a Bucket Website
=======================

Call the :ruby-sdk-api:`delete_bucket_website <Aws/S3/Client.html#delete_bucket_website-instance_method>` method, supplying the name of the bucket.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_ruby_bucket_website.rb
   :lines: 63
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

.. _aws-ruby-sdk-s3-example-bucket-website-delete-bucket:

Delete a Bucket
===============

Call the :ruby-sdk-api:`bucket <Aws/S3/Resource.html#bucket-instance_method>` method of an :ruby-sdk-api:`Aws::S3::Resource <Aws/S3/Resource.html>` object, supplying the name of the bucket.
This returns an :ruby-sdk-api:`Aws::S3::Bucket <Aws/S3/Bucket.html>` object. Then call the :code:`Aws::S3::Bucket` object's
:ruby-sdk-api:`delete <Aws/S3/Bucket.html#delete!-instance_method>` method.
