        Upload Amazon S3 bucket items using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples

The following example uploads the item (file) :file:`C:\file.txt` to the bucket
:code-ruby:`my-bucket` in the :code:`us-west-2` region.  Because :file:`C:\file.txt` is the fully
qualified name of the file, the name of the item is set to the name of the file.
