information about |DDB|, see the `Amazon DynamoDB documentation
<http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/dynamodb>`_. Specifically, see `Ruby and DynamoDB
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GettingStarted.Ruby.html>`_ to

* Create a table.
* Load sample data in JSON format.
* Perform create, read, update, and delete operations on a table item.
