|DDBlong| is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with
seamless scalability. You can use the following examples to access |DDB| services by using the |sdk-ruby|. For more
information about |DDB|, see the `Amazon DynamoDB documentation
<http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/dynamodb>`_. Specifically, see `Ruby and DynamoDB
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GettingStarted.Ruby.html>`_ to
learn how to:

* Create a table.
* Load sample data in JSON format.
* Perform create, read, update, and delete operations on a table item.
* Run simple queries.

The topic also provides a link to a downloadable version of |DDB|, which includes an interactive web
