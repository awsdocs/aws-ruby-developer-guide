##################

You can use the following examples to access |DDBlong| services by using the |sdk-ruby|. For more
information about |DDB|, see the `Amazon DynamoDB documentation
<http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/dynamodb>`_. Specifically, see `Ruby and DynamoDB
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/gettingstartedguide/GettingStarted.Ruby.html>`_ to
learn how to:

* Create a table and load sample data in JSON format.

* Perform create, read, update, and delete operations on the table.

* Run simple queries.

The topic also provides a link to a downloadable version of |DDB|, which includes an interactive web
