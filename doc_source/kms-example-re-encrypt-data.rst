Re-encrypting a Data Blob in |KMS|

    :description:
        Re-encrypt a data blob in AWS KMS using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code example, KMS

The following example uses the |sdk-ruby| 
`re_encrypt <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/KMS/Client.html#re_encrypt-instance_method>`_ method,
which implements the
`ReEncrypt <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_ReEncrypt.html>`_ operation,
to decrypt encrypted data and then immediately re-encrypt data under a new customer master key (CMK).
The operations are performed entirely on the server side within |KMS|,
so they never expose your plaintext outside of |KMS|.
The example displays a readable version of the resulting re-encrypted blob.
