    :description:
        Get a list of the IAM users with administrator privileges with this AWS
        SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, IAM

The following example uses the
:ruby-sdk-api:`get_account_authorization_details <Aws/IAM/Client.html#get_account_authorization_details-instance_method>`,
method to get the list of users for the current account.

Choose :code:`Copy` to save the code locally.

Create the file *get_admins.rb*.

Add the required |IAM| gem and the **os** gem, and use the latter to use the
bundled certificate if you are running on Microsoft Windows.

.. note:: Version 2 of the |sdk-ruby| didn't have service-specific gems.

The main routine starts here.
Create an IAM client and variables to store the number of users,
number of users who have adminstrator privileges,
and the string that identifies a policy that supplies adminstrator privileges.

.. literalinclude:: ./iam/iam_ruby_example_show_admins.rb
   :lines: 126-130
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Call :code:`get_account_authorization_details` to get the details of the account
and get the users for the account from :code:`user_detail_list`.
Keep track of how many users we get,
call :code:`get_admin_count` to get the number of those users who have
administrator privileges,
and keep track of the number of those.

.. literalinclude:: ./iam/iam_ruby_example_show_admins.rb
   :lines: 132-139
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

If the first call to :code:`get_account_authorization_details` did not get
all of the details, call it again and repeat the process of determining
how many have administrator privileges.

.. literalinclude:: ./iam/iam_ruby_example_show_admins.rb
   :lines: 141-156
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Finally, display how many users have administrator privileges.
