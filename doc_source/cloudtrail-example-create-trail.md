# Creating a CloudTrail Trail<a name="cloudtrail-example-create-trail"></a>

This example uses the [create\_trail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/Aws/CloudTrail/Client.html#create_trail-instance_method) method to create a CloudTrail trail in the `us-west-2` region\. It requires two inputs, the name of the trail and the name of the bucket in which CloudTrail stores information\. If the bucket does not have the proper policy, include the **\-p** flag to attach the correct policy to the bucket\.
