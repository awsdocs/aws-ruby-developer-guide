Specifying the Message Visibility Timeout in |SQS|

   :description:
       Specify a message's visibility timeout in Amazon SQS using this AWS SDK for Ruby code
       example.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, SQS

In |SQS|, immediately after a message is received, it remains in the queue. To prevent other consumers
from processing the message again, |SQS| sets a visibility timeout. This is a period of time during which
|SQS| prevents other consuming components from receiving and processing the message. To learn more, see
:SQS-dg:`Visibility Timeout <sqs-visibility-timeout>`.

In this example, you use the |sdk-ruby| with |SQS| to:

#. Get the URL of an existing queue by using :aws-ruby-sqs-client-method:`get_queue_url`.
#. Receive up to 10 messages by using :aws-ruby-sqs-client-method:`receive_message`.
#. Specify the time interval during which messages are not visible after they are received, by using :aws-ruby-sqs-client-method:`change_message_visibility`.

*************
Prerequisites
*************

Before running the example code, you need to install and configure the |sdk-ruby|, as described
in:

* :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-setup-install`
* :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-setup-config`

You also need to create the queue `my-queue`, which you can do in the |SQS| console.
