# AWS SDK for Ruby Developer Guide<a name="welcome"></a>

Welcome to the AWS SDK for Ruby\.

The AWS SDK for Ruby helps take the complexity out of coding by providing Ruby classes for almost all AWS services, including Amazon Simple Storage Service, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, and Amazon DynamoDB\. For a complete list of services supported by the AWS SDK for Ruby, see the [Supported Services](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/blob/master/README.md#supported-services) section of the AWS SDK for Ruby README file\. This section also lists the gems that the AWS SDK for Ruby supports as version 3 modularized the monolithic SDK gem into service\-specific gems\.

## Using the AWS SDK for Ruby with AWS Cloud9<a name="aws-ruby-sdk-developer-guide-cloud9"></a>

### Deploying to the AWS Cloud<a name="aws-ruby-sdk-deploying"></a>

You can use AWS services such as AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS OpsWorks, and CodeDeploy to deploy your application to the AWS Cloud\. For deploying Ruby applications with Elastic Beanstalk, see [Deploying Elastic Beanstalk Applications in Ruby Using EB CLI and Git](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create_deploy_Ruby.html) in the AWS Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide\. For deploying a Ruby on Rails application with AWS OpsWorks, see [Deploying Ruby on Rails Applications to AWS OpsWorks](http://ruby.awsblog.com/post/Tx7FQMT084INCR/Deploying-Ruby-on-Rails-Applications-to-AWS-OpsWorks)\. For an overview of AWS deployment services, see [Overview of Deployment Options on AWS](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/overview-of-deployment-options-on-aws.pdf)\.
