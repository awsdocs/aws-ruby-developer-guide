Working with a Dead Letter Queue in |SQS|

   :description: Work with Amazon SQS dead letter queues using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, SQS

|SQS| provides support for dead letter queues. A dead letter queue is a queue that other (source) queues
can target for messages that can't be processed successfully. You can set aside and isolate these messages
in the dead letter queue to determine why their processing didn't succeed. For more information about dead letter queues, see :SQS-dg:`Using Amazon SQS Dead Letter Queues <sqs-dead-letter-queues>`.

In this example, you use the |sdk-ruby| with |SQS| to:

#. Create a queue that represents a dead letter queue by using :aws-ruby-sqs-client-method:`create_queue`.
#. Associate the dead letter queue with an existing queue by using :aws-ruby-sqs-client-method:`set_queue_attributes`.
#. Send a message to the existing queue by using :aws-ruby-sqs-client-method:`send_message`.
#. Poll the queue by using `Aws::SQS::QueuePoller <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/SQS/QueuePoller.html>`_.
#. Receive messages in the dead letter queue by using :aws-ruby-sqs-client-method:`receive_message`.

*************
Prerequisites
*************

Before running the example code, you need to install and configure the |sdk-ruby|, as described
in:

* :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-setup-install`
* :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-setup-config`

You also need to use the |console| to create the existing queue, `my-queue`.

.. note:: For the sake of simplicity, this example code doesn't demonstrate :aws-ruby-sqs-client-method:`add_permission`.
          In a real-world scenario, you should always restrict access to actions such as SendMessage,
          ReceiveMessage, DeleteMessage, and DeleteQueue. Not doing so could cause
          information disclosure, denial of service, or injection of messages into your queues.
