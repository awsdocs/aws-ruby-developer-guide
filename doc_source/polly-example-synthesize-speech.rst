        Synthesizing speech using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, Amazon Polly

This example uses the
:ruby-sdk-api:`synthesize_speech <Aws/Polly/Client.html#synthesize_speech-instance_method>`
method to get the text from a file and produce an MP3 file containing the synthesized speech.

Choose :code:`Copy` to save the code locally.

Create the file *polly_synthesize_speech.rb*.

Add the required gem.

.. note:: Version 2 of the |sdk-ruby| didn't have service-specific gems.

.. literalinclude:: ./polly/polly_synthesize_speech.rb
   :lines: 13
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Get the name of the text file from the command line.

.. literalinclude:: ./polly/polly_synthesize_speech.rb
   :lines: 17-22
   :dedent: 2
   :language: ruby

Open the text file and read the contents as a string.

.. literalinclude:: ./polly/polly_synthesize_speech.rb
   :lines: 26
   :dedent: 4
   :language: ruby

Create an Amazon Polly client and call :code:`synthesize_speech`.

.. literalinclude:: ./polly/polly_synthesize_speech.rb
   :lines: 35, 37-41
   :dedent: 2
   :language: ruby

Save the resulting synthesized speech as an MP3 file.

.. literalinclude:: ./polly/polly_synthesize_speech.rb
   :lines: 46, 49-53
   :dedent: 2
   :language: ruby

.. note:: The resulting MP3 file is in the MPEG-2 format.
