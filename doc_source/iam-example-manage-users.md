# Managing IAM Users<a name="iam-example-manage-users"></a>

An IAM user represents a person or service that interacts with AWS\. For more information about IAM users, see [IAM Users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html)\.

In this example, you use the AWS SDK for Ruby with IAM to:

1. Get information about available AWS IAM users by using [Aws::IAM::Client\#list\_users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/Aws/IAM/Client.html#list_users-instance_method)\.

1. Create a user by using [Aws::IAM::Client\#create\_user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/Aws/IAM/Client.html#create_user-instance_method)\.

1. Update the userâ€™s name by using [Aws::IAM::Client\#update\_user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/Aws/IAM/Client.html#update_user-instance_method)\.

1. Delete the user by using [Aws::IAM::Client\#delete\_user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/Aws/IAM/Client.html#delete_user-instance_method)\.

## Prerequisites<a name="prerequisites"></a>

Before running the example code, you need to install and configure the AWS SDK for Ruby, as described in:
+  [Installing the AWS SDK for Ruby](setup-install.md#aws-ruby-sdk-setup-install) 
+  [Configuring the AWS SDK for Ruby](setup-config.md#aws-ruby-sdk-setup-config)

# The following code example shows how to to:
# 1. Get a list of user names in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).
# 2. Create a user.
# 3. Update the user's name.
# 4. Delete the user.

require 'aws-sdk-iam'

# Gets a list of available user names in
# AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).
#
# @param iam_client [Aws::IAM::Client] An initialized IAM client.
# @example
#   list_user_names(Aws::IAM::Client.new)
def list_user_names(iam_client)
  response = iam_client.list_users
  if response.key?('users') && response.users.count.positive?
    response.users.each do |user|

    end
  else

  end

end

# Creates a user in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).
#
# @param iam_client [Aws::IAM::Client] An initialized IAM client.
# @param user_name [String] The name of the new user.
# @return [Boolean] true if the user was created; otherwise, false.
# @example
#   exit 1 unless user_created?(Aws::IAM::Client.new, 'my-user')

# Changes the name of a user in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).
#
# Prerequisites:
# - The user in IAM.
#
# @param iam_client [Aws::IAM::Client] An initialized IAM client.
# @param user_current_name [String] The current name of the user.
# @param user_new_name [String] The new name for the user.
# @return [Boolean] true if the name of the user was changed;
#   otherwise, false.
# @example
#   exit 1 unless user_name_changed?(
#     Aws::IAM::Client.new,
#     'my-user',
#     'my-changed-user'
#   )

# Deletes a user in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).
#
# Prerequisites:
# - The user in IAM.
#
# @param iam_client [Aws::IAM::Client] An initialized IAM client.
# @param user_name [String] The name of the user.
# @return [Boolean] true if the user was deleted; otherwise, false.
# @example
#   exit 1 unless user_deleted?(Aws::IAM::Client.new, 'my-user')
