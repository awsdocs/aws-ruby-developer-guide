Deploying to the AWS Cloud
--------------------------

You can use AWS services such as |AEBlong|, |OPS|, and |ACD| to deploy your application to the AWS Cloud.
For deploying Ruby applications with |AEB|, see :AEB-dg:`Working with Ruby <create_deploy_Ruby>`
in the |AEB-dg|. For deploying a Ruby on Rails application with |OPS|, see
`Deploying Ruby on Rails Applications to AWS OpsWorks <http://ruby.awsblog.com/post/Tx7FQMT084INCR/Deploying-Ruby-on-Rails-Applications-to-AWS-OpsWorks>`_.
