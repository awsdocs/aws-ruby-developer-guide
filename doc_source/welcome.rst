        Build Ruby applications on top of APIs that use the cost-effective, scalable, and reliable
        AWS infrastructure services with the |sdk-ruby|.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for ruby, aws.rb, aws-sdk-core gem, ruby code examples

Welcome to the |sdk-ruby|.

The |sdk-ruby| helps take the complexity out of coding by providing Ruby classes for almost all AWS
services, including |S3long|, |EC2long|, and |DDBlong|.
For a complete list of services supported by the
|sdk-ruby|, see the `Supported Services
<https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/blob/master/README.md#supported-services>`_
section of the |sdk-ruby| Readme file.
This section also lists the gems that the |sdk-ruby| supports as version 3
modularized the monolithic SDK gem into service-specific gems.

.. _aws-ruby-sdk-deploying:

Deploying to the AWS Cloud
--------------------------

You can use AWS services such as |AEBlong|, |OPS|, and |ACD| to deploy your application to the AWS Cloud.
For deploying Ruby applications with |AEB|, see
:AEB-dg:`Deploying Elastic Beanstalk Applications in Ruby Using EB CLI and Git <create_deploy_Ruby>`
in the |AEB-dg|. For deploying a Ruby on Rails application with |OPS|, see
`Deploying Ruby on Rails Applications to AWS OpsWorks <http://ruby.awsblog.com/post/Tx7FQMT084INCR/Deploying-Ruby-on-Rails-Applications-to-AWS-OpsWorks>`_.
For an overview of AWS deployment services, see
`Overview of Deployment Options on AWS <https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/overview-of-deployment-options-on-aws.pdf>`_.

Maintenance and support for SDK major versions
==============================================
