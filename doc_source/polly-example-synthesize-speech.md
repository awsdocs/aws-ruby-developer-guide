# Synthesizing Speech<a name="polly-example-synthesize-speech"></a>

This example uses the [synthesize\_speech](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/Aws/Polly/Client.html#synthesize_speech-instance_method) method to get the text from a file and produce an MP3 file containing the synthesized speech\.

Choose `Copy` to save the code locally\.

Create the file *polly\_synthesize\_speech\.rb*\.

Add the required gem\.

**Note**  
Version 2 of the AWS SDK for Ruby didnâ€™t have service\-specific gems\.

  # Create an Amazon Polly client using
  # credentials from the shared credentials file ~/.aws/credentials
  # and the configuration (region) from the shared configuration file ~/.aws/config
  polly = Aws::Polly::Client.new

  resp = polly.synthesize_speech({
    output_format: "mp3",
    text: contents,
    voice_id: "Joanna",

  # Save output
  # Get just the file name
  #  abc/xyz.txt -> xyx.txt
  name = File.basename(filename)

  # Split up name so we get just the xyz part
  parts = name.split('.')
  first_part = parts[0]
  mp3_file = first_part + '.mp3'

  IO.copy_stream(resp.audio_stream, mp3_file)

  puts 'Wrote MP3 content to: ' + mp3_file
rescue StandardError => ex
  puts 'Got error:'
  puts 'Error message:'
  puts ex.message
end
```

**Note**  
The resulting MP3 file is in the MPEG\-2 format\.
