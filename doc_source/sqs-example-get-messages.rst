   :description: Receive messages in Amazon SQS using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, SQS

The following example displays the body of up to 10 messages in the |SQS| queue with the URL
:code:`URL` in the :code:`us-west-2` region.

.. note:: :code:`receive_message` does not guarantee to get all messages (see `Properties of
   Distributed Queues
   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/DistributedQueues.html>`_),
   and by default does not delete the message.
