# Creating a Snapshot of an Amazon RDS Instance<a name="rds-example-create-snapshot"></a>

The following example creates a snapshot for the Amazon RDS instance represented by *instance\_name* in the `us-west-2` region\.

**Note**  
If your instance is a member of a cluster, you canâ€™t create a snapshot of the instance\. Instead, you must create a snapshot of the cluster \(see [Creating a Snapshot of an Amazon RDS Cluster](rds-example-create-cluster-snapshot.md#aws-ruby-sdk-rds-example-create-cluster-snapshot)\)\.
