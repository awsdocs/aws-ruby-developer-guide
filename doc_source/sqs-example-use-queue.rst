        Learn how to work with Amazon SQS queues using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, SQS

|SQS| provides highly scalable hosted queues for storing messages as they travel between applications
or microservices. To learn more about queues, see :SQS-dg:`How Amazon SQS Queues Work <sqs-how-it-works>`.

In this example, you use the |sdk-ruby| with |SQS| to:

#. Get a list of your queues by using :aws-ruby-sqs-client-method:`list_queues`.
#. Create a queue by using :aws-ruby-sqs-client-method:`create_queue`.
#. Get the queue's URL by using :aws-ruby-sqs-client-method:`get_queue_url`.
#. Delete the queue by using :aws-ruby-sqs-client-method:`delete_queue`.

*************
Prerequisites
*************

Before running the example code, you need to install and configure the |sdk-ruby|, as described
in:

* :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-setup-install`
* :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-setup-config`
