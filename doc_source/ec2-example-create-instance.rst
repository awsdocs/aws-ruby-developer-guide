        Create Amazon EC2 instances using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, Amazon EC2

The following example creates an |EC2| instance :code:`MyGroovyInstance`, with the tag :code:`Group` and value :code:`MyGroovyGroup`. The instance is created
in Availability Zone :code:`us-west-2a`. The instance has the machine image :code:`MACHINE_IMAGE`
for the account with ID :code:`ACCOUNT_ID`,
the security group with the ID :code:`SECURITY_GROUP_ID`, and the subnet
with the ID :code:`SUBNET_ID`. Then it displays the instance's ID and public IP address.

.. note:: In the empty script value, you can add instructions that your |EC2| instance executes when it starts.
