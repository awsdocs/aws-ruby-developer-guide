method to get the list of lexicons in the :code:`us-west-2` region.

Choose :code:`Copy` to save the code locally.

Create the file *polly_list_lexicons.rb*.

Add the required gem.

.. note:: Version 2 of the |sdk-ruby| didn't have service-specific gems.

Create an Amazon Polly client and call :code:`list_lexicons`.

.. literalinclude:: ./polly/polly_list_lexicons.rb
   :lines: 19, 21
   :dedent: 2
   :language: ruby
