        Get the list of voices that are available for use when requesting speech synthesis using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, Amazon Polly

This example uses the
:ruby-sdk-api:`describe_voices <Aws/Polly/Client.html#describe_voices-instance_method>`
method to get the list of US English voices in the :code:`us-west-2` region.

Choose :code:`Copy` to save the code locally.

Create the file *polly_describe_voices.rb*.

Add the required gem.

.. note:: Version 2 of the |sdk-ruby| didn't have service-specific gems.

.. literalinclude:: ./polly/polly_describe_voices.rb
   :lines: 13
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Create an Amazon Polly client and call :code:`describe_voices` for US English.

.. literalinclude:: ./polly/polly_describe_voices.rb
   :lines: 19, 22
   :dedent: 2
   :language: ruby

Display the name and gender of the voices.
