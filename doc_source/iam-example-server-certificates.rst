        Learn to work with IAM server certificates using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, IAM

To enable HTTPS connections to your website or application on AWS, you need an SSL/TLS server certificate. To use a certificate that you obtained from an external provider with your website or application on AWS, you must upload the certificate to |IAM| or import it into AWS Certificate Manager. For more information about server certificates, see :IAM-ug:`Working with Server Certificates <id_credentials_server-certs>`.

In this example, you use the |sdk-ruby| with |IAM| to:

#. Update a server certificate, using :aws-ruby-iam-client-method:`update_server_certificate`.
#. Delete the server certificate, using :aws-ruby-iam-client-method:`delete_server_certificate`.
#. List information about any remaining server certificates, using :aws-ruby-iam-client-method:`list_server_certificates`.

*************
Prerequisites
*************

Before running the example code, you need to install and configure the |sdk-ruby|, as described
in:

* :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-setup-install`
* :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-setup-config`

.. note:: The server certificate must already exist, or the script will throw
          an `Aws::IAM::Errors::NoSuchEntity` error.
