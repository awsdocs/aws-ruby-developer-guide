Creating a CMK in |KMS|

    :description:
        Create an AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, KMS

The following example uses the |sdk-ruby| `create_key <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/KMS/Client.html#create_key-instance_method>`_
method,
which implements the
`CreateKey <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_CreateKey.html>`_ operation
to create a customer master key (CMK).
Because the example only encrypts a small amount of data,
a CMK is fine for our purposes. For larger amounts of data,
use the CMK to encrypt a data encryption key (DEK).
