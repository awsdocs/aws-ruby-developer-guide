Encrypting an Amazon S3 Bucket Object on the Server
###################################################

    :description:
        Encrypt Amazon S3 bucket objects on the server using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples

The following example uses the
:ruby-sdk-api:`put_object <Aws/S3/Client.html#put_object-instance_method>` method
to add the object :code-ruby:`my_item` to the bucket
:code-ruby:`my_bucket` in the :code:`us-west-2` region
with server-side encryption set KMS.

Note that this differs from :doc:`s3-example-default-server-side-encryption`,
is in that case, the objects are encrypted without you having to explicitly perform the operation.

Choose :code:`Copy` to save the code locally.

Create the file *encrypt_object_sse.rb*.

Add the required |S3| gem.

.. note:: Version 2 of the |sdk-ruby| didn't have service-specific gems.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_add_sses3_encrypt_item.rb
   :lines: 13
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Set the bucket and object name and get the object from the file as a string.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_add_sses3_encrypt_item.rb
   :lines: 15,16,19
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Create an |S3| client and call :code:`put_object` to upload the object to the bucket.
Notice that the :code:`server_side_encryption` property is set to :code:`aws:kms`,
indicating that |S3| encrypts the object using KMS.
Finally, display a success message to the user.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_add_sses3_encrypt_item.rb
   :lines: 22,23,25-32
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby
