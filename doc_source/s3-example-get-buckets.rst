Getting Information about All |S3| Buckets

    :description:
        Get Amazon S3 bucket information using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, Amazon S3

The following example lists the names of up to 50 of your |S3| buckets.  Copy the code and save it
as :file:`buckets.rb`. Notice that although the :code:`Resource` object is created in the
:code:`us-west-2` region, |S3| returns buckets to which you have access, regardless of the region
they are in.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3-ruby-example-show-50-buckets.rb
   :lines: 13-20
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

.. note:: When you specify a region, the :code:`buckets` method calls the
   :code:`Client#list_buckets` method, which returns a list of all buckets owned by the
   authenticated sender of the request.  See :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-s3-example-get-buckets-in-region` to
   learn how to filter this list to get the buckets only in a specific region.
