    :description:
        Create a DynamoDB table using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, DynamoDB

The following example creates the table :code-ruby:`Movies` with two required
attributes: :code-ruby:`year` and :code-ruby:`title` in the :code-ruby:`us-west-2` region.

The :code-ruby:`wait_until` call blocks you from using the table until
|DDB| has created it.
By default, the |DDB| client's :code-ruby:`wait_until` method checks every 20
seconds, up to a maximum of 500 seconds, to see if the table was created.
