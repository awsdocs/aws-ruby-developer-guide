        Create public and private keys to upload and download encrypted objects to
        Amazon S3 buckets using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples

The following example uses the
`PKey <http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/openssl/rdoc/OpenSSL/PKey.html>`_
class to create a public and private keys.
Use the public key to encrypt objects on the client before you upload them to an
|S3| bucket.
Use the private key and pass phrase to decrypt objects on the client after you
download them from an |S3| bucket.
The
:doc:`s3-example-client-side-encryption-with-public-key` and
:doc:`s3-example-client-side-decrypt-item-with-private-key` examples
use public and private keys, respectively.

Choose :code:`Copy` to save the code locally.

Create the file *create_rsa_keys.rb*.

Add the required OpenSSL gem.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/create_rsa_keys.rb
   :lines: 13
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Get the pass phrase,
which is used to seed and create the key,
from the command line.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/create_rsa_keys.rb
   :lines: 16-21
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Create the RSA key pairs.
Save the public key as *public_key.pem*
and the private key as *private_secure_key.pem*.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/create_rsa_keys.rb
   :lines: 22-37
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Display the names of the key files and the pass phrase.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/create_rsa_keys.rb
   :lines: 39-41
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby
