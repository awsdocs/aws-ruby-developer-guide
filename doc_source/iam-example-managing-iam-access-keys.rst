    :description:
        Learn to manage IAM access keys using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, IAM

Users need their own access keys to make programmatic calls to AWS from the |sdk-ruby|. To fill this need,
you can create, modify, view, or rotate access keys (access key IDs and secret access keys) for |IAM|
users. By default, when you create an access key, its status is Active. This means the user can use the
access key for API calls. For more information about access keys, see :IAM-ug:`Managing Access Keys for IAM Users <id_credentials_access-keys>`.

In this example, you use the |sdk-ruby| with |IAM| to:

#. List AWS IAM user access keys, using :aws-ruby-iam-client-method:`list_access_keys`.
#. Create an access key, using :aws-ruby-iam-client-method:`create_access_key`.
#. Determine when access keys were last used, using :aws-ruby-iam-client-method:`get_access_key_last_used`.
#. Deactivate access keys, using :aws-ruby-iam-client-method:`update_access_key`.
#. Delete the access key, using :aws-ruby-iam-client-method:`delete_access_key`.

*************
Prerequisites
*************

Before running the example code, you need to install and configure the |sdk-ruby|, as described
in:

* :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-setup-install`
* :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-setup-config`

You will also need to create the user (`my-user`) specified in the script. You can create a new IAM user in the IAM console or programmatically, as shown at :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-iam-example-add-user`.
