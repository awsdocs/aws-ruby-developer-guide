Getting Information about All |S3| Buckets in a Region

    :description:
        Get Amazon S3 bucket information for a specific region using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples

The following example lists the names of the first 50 buckets for the :code:`us-west-2` region.
If you don't specify a limit, |S3| lists all buckets in :code:`us-west-2`.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3-ruby-example-show-buckets-in-region.rb
   :lines: 13-22
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

.. note:: If a bucket is not in the region in which you instantiated your :code-ruby:`Resource`
   object, the SDK emits a warning message when you call :code-ruby:`get_bucket_location`. You can
   suppress this message by redirecting STDERR.

   On Windows, append :code:`2> nul` to the command.

   On Linux or iOS, append :code:`2> /dev/null` to the command.
