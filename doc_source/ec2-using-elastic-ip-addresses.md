# Using Elastic IP Addresses in Amazon EC2<a name="ec2-using-elastic-ip-addresses"></a>

The following code example:

1. Displays information about any addresses associated with an \(Amazon EC2\) instance\.

1. Creates an Elastic IP address in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud \(Amazon VPC\)\.

1. Associates the address with the instance\.

1. Displays information again about addresses associated with the instance\. This time, the new address association should display\.

1. Releases the address\.

1. Displays information again about addresses associated with the instance\. This time, the released address should not display\.
