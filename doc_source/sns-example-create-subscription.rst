    :description:
        Create a subscription in an Amazon SNS topic using the AWS SDK for Ruby.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, SNS

The following example creates a subscription for the topic with the ARN
:code:`arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789:MyGroovyTopic` for a user who has the email address
:code:`MyGroovyUser@MyGroovy.com` in the :code:`us-west-2` region, and displays the resulting ARN.
Initially the ARN value is pending confirmation. When the user confirms their email address, this
value becomes a true ARN.
