   :keywords: AWS SDK Ruby code examples, Amazon Polly

Amazon Polly is a cloud service that converts text into lifelike speech.
The |sdk-go| examples can integrate Amazon Polly into your applications.
Learn more about Amazon Polly at
`Amazon Polly documentation <https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/polly/>`_.
The examples assume you have already set up and configured the SDK
(that is, you've imported all required packages and set your credentials and region).
For more information, see :doc:`setup-install` and :doc:`setup-config`.

You can download complete versions of these example files from the
`aws-doc-sdk-examples <https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/ruby/polly>`_
repository on GitHub.
