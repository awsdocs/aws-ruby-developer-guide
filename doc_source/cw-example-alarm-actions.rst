Enabling and Disabling |CWlong| Alarm Actions
#############################################

.. meta::
   :description: Enable and disable Amazon CloudWatch alarm actions using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, CloudWatch alarms

An |CWlong| alarm watches a single metric over a time period you specify. The |CW| alarm performs one
or more actions based on the value of the metric, relative to a given threshold over a number of time
periods. For more information, see :CW-ug:`Creating Amazon CloudWatch Alarms <AlarmThatSendsEmail>` in
the |CW-ug|.

In this example, you use the |sdk-ruby| with |CW| to:

#. Enable an action for a |CW| alarm by using `Aws::CloudWatch::Client#put_metric_alarm <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/CloudWatch/Client.html#put_metric_alarm-instance_method>`_.
#. Disable all actions for an alarm by using `Aws::CloudWatch::Client#disable_alarm_actions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/CloudWatch/Client.html#disable_alarm_actions-instance_method>`_.

The `complete code <https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/ruby/cloudwatch/cw-ruby-example-alarm-actions.rb>`_
for this example is available on GitHub.

*************
Prerequisites
*************

Before running the example code, you need to install and configure the |sdk-ruby|, as described
in:

* :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-setup-install`
* :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-setup-config`

You also need to replace `arn:aws:sns:REGION-ID:ACCOUNT-ID:TOPIC-NAME` with the ARN for a valid |SNS| topic.
