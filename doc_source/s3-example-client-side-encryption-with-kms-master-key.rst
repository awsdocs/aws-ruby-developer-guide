    :description:
        Encrypt Amazon S3 bucket objects with a client-side AWS KMS key using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples

The following example uses the
:ruby-sdk-api:`put_object <Aws/S3/Client.html#put_object-instance_method>` method
to add the object :code-ruby:`my_item` to the bucket
:code-ruby:`my_bucket` in the :code:`us-west-2` region.

Choose :code:`Copy` to save the code locally.

Create the file *encrypt_object_csekms.rb*.

Add the required |S3| gem.

.. note:: Version 2 of the |sdk-ruby| didn't have service-specific gems.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_add_cskms_encrypt_item.rb
   :lines: 13
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Get the AWS KMS key from the command line,
where :code:`key` is an AWS KMS key ID as created in the :doc:`kms-example-create-key` example.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_add_cskms_encrypt_item.rb
   :lines: 16-21
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Set the bucket and object name and get the contents of the object from the file as a string.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_add_cskms_encrypt_item.rb
   :lines: 23,24,27
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Create a |KMS| and |S3| encryption client, call :code:`put_object` to upload the object to the bucket,
and display a success message.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_add_cskms_encrypt_item.rb
   :lines: 30-45
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby
