   :description: Learn how to manage Amazon EC2 instances using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, Amazon EC2


In this example, you use the |sdk-ruby| with |EC2| to:

#. Stop an existing |EC2| instance by using :aws-ruby-ec2-client-method:`stop_instances`.
#. Restart the instance by using :aws-ruby-ec2-client-method:`start_instances`.
#. Reboot the instance by using :aws-ruby-ec2-client-method:`reboot_instances`.
#. Enable detailed monitoring for the instance by using :aws-ruby-ec2-client-method:`monitor_instances`.
#. Get information about available instances by using :aws-ruby-ec2-client-method:`describe_instances`.

*************
Prerequisites
*************

Before running the example code, you need to install and configure the |sdk-ruby|, as described
in:

* :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-setup-install`
* :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-setup-config`

You also need to replace `INSTANCE-ID` in the code with the instance ID of an existing EC2 instance.
