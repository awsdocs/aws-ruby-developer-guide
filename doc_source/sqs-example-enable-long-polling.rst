##############################
Enabling Long Polling in |SQS|
##############################

.. meta::
   :description: Enable long polling in Amazon SQS using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, SQS

Long polling helps lower your cost of using |SQS| by reducing the number of empty responses and eliminating
false empty responses. For more information about long polling, see :SQS-dg:`Amazon SQS Long Polling <sqs-long-polling>`.

In this example, you use the |sdk-ruby| with |SQS| to:

#. Create a queue and set it for long polling by using :aws-ruby-sqs-client-method:`create_queue`.
#. Set long polling for an existing queue by using :aws-ruby-sqs-client-method:`set_queue_attributes`.
#. Set long polling when receiving messages for a queue by using :aws-ruby-sqs-client-method:`receive_message`.

*************
Prerequisites
*************

Before running the example code, you need to install and configure the |sdk-ruby|, as described
in:

* :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-setup-install`
* :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-setup-config`

You also need to create the queues `existing-queue` and `receive-queue`, which you can do in the |SQS| console.
