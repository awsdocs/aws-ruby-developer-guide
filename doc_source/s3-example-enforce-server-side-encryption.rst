Requiring Encryption on the Server to Upload Amazon S3 Bucket Objects

    :description:
        Require server-side encryption to upload Amazon S3 bucket using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples

The following example uses the
:ruby-sdk-api:`put_bucket_policy <Aws/S3/Client.html#put_bucket_policy-instance_method>` method
to require that objects uploaded to an |S3| bucket have |S3| encrypt the object with an AWS KMS key.
Attempts to upload an object without specifying that |S3| encrypt the object with an AWS KMS key
raise an :code:`Aws::S3::Errors::AccessDenied` exception.

Avoid using this configuration option if you use default server-side encryption as described in
:doc:`s3-example-default-server-side-encryption` as they could conflict and result in unexpected
results.

Choose :code:`Copy` to save the code locally.

Create the file *add_sses3_policy.rb*.

Add the required |S3| gem and set the bucket name.

.. note:: Version 2 of the |sdk-ruby| didn't have service-specific gems.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_add_bucket_sses3_encryption_policy.rb
   :lines: 13,15
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Create an |S3| policy that requires server-side KMS encryption on objects
uploaded to the bucket.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_add_bucket_sses3_encryption_policy.rb
   :lines: 18-47
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Create the |S3| client, apply the policy to the bucket, and print a success message.

.. literalinclude:: ./s3/s3_add_bucket_sses3_encryption_policy.rb
   :lines: 50-58
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby
