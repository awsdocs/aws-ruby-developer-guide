Managing IAM Account Aliases

        Learn to manage IAM account aliases using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, IAM

If you want the URL for your sign-in page to contain your company name or other friendly identifier instead
of your AWS account ID, you can create an |IAM| account alias for your AWS account ID.
If you create an |IAM| account alias, your sign-in page URL changes to incorporate the alias. For more
information about |IAM| account aliases, see :IAM-ug:`Your AWS Account ID and Its Alias <console_account-alias>`.

In this example, you use the |sdk-ruby| with |IAM| to:

#. List AWS account aliases, using :aws-ruby-iam-client-method:`list_account_aliases`.
#. Create an account alias, using :aws-ruby-iam-client-method:`create_account_alias`.
#. Delete the account alias, using :aws-ruby-iam-client-method:`delete_account_alias`.

*************
Prerequisites
*************

Before running the example code, you need to install and configure the |sdk-ruby|, as described
in:

* :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-setup-install`
* :ref:`aws-ruby-sdk-setup-config`

In the example code, change the `my-account-alias` string to something that will be unique across all Amazon Web Services products.
