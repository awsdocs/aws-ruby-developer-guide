# Amazon Polly Examples Using the AWS SDK for Ruby<a name="polly-examples"></a>

Amazon Polly is a cloud service that converts text into lifelike speech\. The AWS SDK for Ruby examples can integrate Amazon Polly into your applications\. Learn more about Amazon Polly at [Amazon Polly documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/polly/)\. The examples assume you have already set up and configured the SDK \(that is, youâ€™ve imported all required packages and set your credentials and region\)\. For more information, see [Installing the AWS SDK for Ruby](setup-install.md) and [Configuring the AWS SDK for Ruby](setup-config.md)\.

You can download complete versions of these example files from the [aws\-doc\-sdk\-examples](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/ruby/polly) repository on GitHub\.
