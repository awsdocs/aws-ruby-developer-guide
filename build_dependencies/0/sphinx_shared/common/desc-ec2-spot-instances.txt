|EC2| *spot instances* allow you to bid on spare EC2 computing capacity. Since spot instances are
often available at a discount compared to on-demand pricing, you can significantly reduce the cost
of running your applications, grow your application’s compute capacity and throughput for the same
budget, and enable new types of cloud computing applications.
