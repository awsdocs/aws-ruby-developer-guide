* Set credentials in the AWS credentials profile file on your local system, located at:

    * |aws-credfile-loc-unixes| on |unixes|

    * |aws-credfile-loc-windows| on Windows

    This file should contain lines in the following format:

    .. code-block:: cfg

        [default]
        aws_access_key_id = your_access_key_id
        aws_secret_access_key = your_secret_access_key

    Substitute your own AWS credentials values for the values *your_access_key_id* and
    *your_secret_access_key*.

* Set the :envvar:`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and :envvar:`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables.

    To set these variables on |unixes|, use :command:`export`:

    .. code-block:: sh

        export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
        export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key

    To set these variables on Windows, use :command:`set`:

    .. code-block:: bat

        set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
        set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key

* For an EC2 instance, specify an IAM role and then give your EC2 instance access to that role. See
  :ec2-ug:`IAM Roles for Amazon EC2 <iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2>` in the |EC2-ug| for a detailed
  discussion about how this works.
